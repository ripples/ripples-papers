Call for Papers
The Web revolution, the popularity of on-line learning, and the broad availability of computers in schools, colleges, universities, workplaces and in other social settings has caused a qualitative change in the field of learning technologies. Both the variety and the complexity of e-learning tools have increased dramatically over the last 10 years. TLT embraces the field as a whole and provides a space to publish archival quality papers in these areas.
The title covers all advances in learning technologies, including but not limited to the following topics:
 - Innovative online learning systems
 - Intelligent tutors
 - Educational software applications and games
 - Simulation systems for education and training
 - Collaborative learning tools
 - Devices and interfaces for learning
 - Interactive techniques for learning
 - Personalized and adaptive learning systems
 - Tools for formative and summative assessment
 - Ontologies for learning systems
 - Standards and web services that support learning
 - Authoring tools for learning materials
 - Computer support for peer tutoring
 - Learning via discovery, field, and lab work
 - Social learning techniques
 - Social networks and infrastructures for learning and knowledge sharing
 - Creation and management of learning objects
The IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies is published online, using a delayed open-access policy under which paying subscribers and per-article purchasers have access to newly published content, and then 12 months after the publication of each issue, all readers will have access to the content, free of charge.


ACM Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE) 

TOCE publishes high quality, peer-reviewed, archival papers in computing education. Papers published in TOCE take a scholarly approach to teaching and learning, establish a clear connection to student learning, and appeal to a broad audience interested in computing education: instructors, researchers, curriculum designers, and administrators.

Guidelines for Authors

Reviewers evaluate manuscripts according to the following criteria. These criteria relate to the appropriateness of the paper to the journal, the significance of its content, and the quality of the presentation. Manuscripts are expected to:
 - have content that can be directly applied by classroom instructors or curriculum designers;
 - appeal to a broad audience interested in computing education;
 - address significant problem(s) of lasting value;
 - build upon (and cite) relevant references;
 - adequately evaluate any teaching intervention (e.g. tool, visualization, instructional method) in terms of its impact on learning in actual use
 - use appropriate methodology, both for the teaching intervention and its evaluation;
 - provide sufficient detail to replicate and evaluate;
 - be clearly and carefully written; and
 - adhere to accepted standards of style, usage, and composition.
Each submitted paper is initially reviewed by one of the Editors-in-chief, who makes an evaluation as to the suitability of the paper for this journal. If the paper fits the scope of the journal, the editor assigns the manuscript to an Associate Editor. The Associate Editor assigns the paper to at least three reviewers, and, based on these, makes a recommendation to the Editors-in-Chief. The Editors-in-chiefs' decision is based on these reviews and the Associate Editor's recommendation.

Submissions should follow the online guidelines for Electronically Submitting Articles to ACM Journals. All manuscripts and revisions are to be submitted electronically using ACM's Manuscript Central interface.

ACM Inroads

The ACM Inroads magazine serves professionals interested in advancing computing education on a global scale. The goal of the publication is to generate new ‘inroads’ in the theory and practice of computing education and to share those discoveries by fostering dialogue, cooperation, and collaboration with educators worldwide.

Each issue of ACM Inroads presents the latest work, insights, and research in computing education as written by educators and professionals for educators. Authors represent an international community of scholars and professionals who reflect on and contribute to the computing profession. Every edition offers an array of thought-provoking commentaries from many leading luminaries together with a diverse collection of articles of varying lengths that examine in detail some current research and practices within the computing community. The publication reaches a global audience; therefore, it is imperative that authors writing for ACM Inroads prepare manuscripts in a clear, crisp voice that professionals and educators from a wide variety of backgrounds and disciplines will appreciate.

Remember that ACM Inroads is a magazine, not a journal. Therefore, ACM encourages the use of appropriate and relevant images to accompany articles. An appropriate communication of permission and source citation must accompany any artwork derived from sources other than the author’s own material. It is the author's responsibility to obtain such copyright permission and credit wording. For more information on handling third party materials, please see guidelines as published by ACM. them identify original material, including prior publications of authors. 


Journal of Computing in Higher Education
Research & Integration of Instructional Technology
Springer Open Access

Covers policies, issues, problems, and research associated with instructional technology and digital learning
Examines course management tools, new teaching methods and trends
Discusses all aspects of integrating technology with teaching and learning
Presents intervention research focusing on methods in higher education
Journal of Computing in Higher Education, JCHE, publishes original research, literature reviews, implementation and evaluation studies, and theoretical, conceptual, and policy papers that contribute to our understanding of the issues, problems, and research associated with instructional technologies and educational environments. JCHE publishes well-documented articles and provides a comprehensive source of information on instructional technology integration. Priority is given to the publication of rigorous, original manuscripts concerning research and integration of instructional technology in higher education. JCHE provides perspectives on the research and integration of instructional technology in higher education.

Educational Technology Research and Development
A bi-monthly publication of the Association for Educational Communications & Technology
Springer Open Access

The only scholarly journal for the field focusing entirely on research and development in educational technology

The Research Section assigns highest priority in reviewing manuscripts to rigorous original quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods studies on topics relating to applications of technology or instructional design in educational settings.  Such contexts include K-12, higher education, and adult learning (e.g., in corporate training settings).  Analytical papers that evaluate important research issues related to educational technology research and reviews of the literature on similar topics are also published. This section features well documented articles on the practical aspects of research as well as applied theory in educational practice and provides a comprehensive source of current research information in instructional technology.

The Development Section publishes research on planning, implementation, evaluation and management of a variety of instructional technologies and learning environments. Empirically-based formative evaluations and theoretically-based instructional design research papers are welcome, as are papers that report outcomes of innovative approaches in applying technology to instructional development. Papers for the Development section may involve a variety of research methods and should focus on one or more aspects of the instructional development process; when relevant and possible, papers should discuss the implications of instructional design decisions and provide evidence linking outcomes to those decisions.
